# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**QnA** is a Piazza-style course question-and-answer board. Students post questions, course staff (and other students) answer them, and every question is the root of a discussion thread that stays open until staff explicitly close it. It includes a RAG-based auto-responder (see `docs/design-rag.md`).
